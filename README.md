ML Assignment 1: Digit Recognition (using Tensorflow)

# - Assignment 1

This is my  Machine Learning assignment** for recognizing handwritten digits using the **MNIST dataset**.  

## About the Assignment
- The model is trained using **TensorFlow**.
- It learns to recognize handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset.
- Then it test the accuracy of the trained model .

## Files
- **digit.ipynb** → it's done in Google colab.

## How It Works
1. Load the MNIST dataset from TensorFlow.
2. Build a simple neural network model.
3. Train the model on training data.
4. Test the model on test data to see accuracy.
5. Predict some sample digits.
